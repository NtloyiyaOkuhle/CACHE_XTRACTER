# CACHE_XTRACTER
This code is a Python script that extracts contacts data from a SQLite database file generated by Internet Evidence Finder (IEF) software, and outputs it to a CSV file.

To use this code, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You also need to have Internet Evidence Finder (IEF) software installed and have a SQLite database file that contains the data you want to extract.

Once you have Python and IEF installed, you can run the script by opening a command prompt or terminal window, navigating to the directory where the script is saved, and typing the following command:

python script_name.py IEF_DATABASE OUTPUT_DIR

Here, script_name.py is the name of the Python script, IEF_DATABASE is the path to the IEF SQLite database file you want to extract contacts from, and OUTPUT_DIR is the directory where you want to save the CSV output file.

The script will then run and output a CSV file containing the contacts data. The script will also print some status messages to the console as it runs
